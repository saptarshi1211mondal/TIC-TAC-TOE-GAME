# How To Play ?
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

This classic game not only provides timeless entertainment but also serves as a valuable tool for children's developmental growth.
